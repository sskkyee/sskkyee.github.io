## The ASCII art with the shrine of Mr. Whiskers was probably the most time consuming ASCII I did for this project. Instead of using one pre-made ASCII, I had to take bits and pieces from various ASCII art and space then all out and remake portions of them to get the candle placement just right and to get the correct size of the cat photo.
