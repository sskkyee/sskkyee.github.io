## The ASCII art with the shrine of Mr. Whiskers was probably the most time consuming ASCII I did for this project. Instead of using one pre-made ASCII, I had to take bits and pieces from various ASCII art and space then all out and remake portions of them to get the candle placement just right and to get the correct size of the cat photo.

# This was my final called Bubblegum Mayhem.
## Bubblegum Mayhem is a game centered around this storyline where you accidentally fall into this land that's made out of all these different kinds of gum. You explore various locations of this strange world centered around numerous gum brands. Once you've finished exploring the places that piqued your interest, you eventually find a ladder back to the surface and after you climb up it you find yourself back home in the normal world again.

## The nested loop shown in the title screen (being the <--> text-made "stairs" aka wad of gum the player initially falls through) took me a very long time to figure out how to display. I already knew how to produce working code that would create the nested loop from experience in a previous project, but that was a C# project- so trying to integrate it into WPF application was a challenge for me at first because I was initially unfamiliar with what kind of changes I would need to make to the code in order for its output to be displayed into a TextBlock.

# A project from this class was the Adopt A Fish game.
## This was a project where we set up a system where the player could adopt various fish, name their fish, and go to a market to buy stuff for their fish.

## I had a lot of fun making random names for the fish. I used a lot of real-life fish breeds I knew the names of due to my experience at a pet store where I had to learn a lot about fish breeds in order to help customers figure out what fish would be in their best interest to buy. I've had a lot of moments where I've handled many of the breeds I listed and I find all of them very fascinating, so it was fun to be able to reference them all in this project.

# Another small project we worked on in class was a demo of a Map system. 
## This was a more visual set up where we learned how to use colors and loops to demonstrate what location the player was at.

## It was fun to learn how to make such an interesting system regarding the usage of text, colors, symbols, and loops to make a visually appealing map. The green majority of the map shown in the screenshot was correlated to a color being preset for a specific enviornment- in this case, a rainforest.

# We also did a Substitution Cipher for class.
## This cipher would encode and decode using a substitution cipher.

## I found it very interesting to see this be the code behind the application when we were writing it out in class. It was very cool to navigate writing encryotions.
